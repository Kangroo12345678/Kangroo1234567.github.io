Hi :-) I am Michael Kang (Yuliang Kang) and this is my unfinished temporary personal website. 
I am a dream-to-be researcher(I feel that scientist is still too big a word for me). I am currently interested in bayesian statistics, representation learning, and diffusion. And you could kinda see from my interests: yes I am more of a fan of explainable AI.
I attempted a little in economics, more specifically game theory, which I have not yet gotten a good grasp of.
This website is currently only used for personal use: journaling my progress in academics and life. Blogs on research, readings, and fitness will be posted here.
